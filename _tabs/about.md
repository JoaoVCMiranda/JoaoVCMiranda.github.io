# Who am I ?
Hi, I'm João Victor Cavalcante Miranda, the most effective way to get in touch with me is via email(which is in the link aside), I'm currently living at São Paulo, Brazil.

# Objective
I'd like to share with you some of the things I'm (or was) engaged with, I like to know people and improve myself so while I was applying for a summer intern I developed this quick site to be my first serious CV. And as always, it's going to be improved with time.

# Work Experience
In high school I was the press director of one of the ONU simulations that happened there every year, therefore I responsabilized myself for creating the environment for my friends work in a form of a wordpress site and for task delegation, during the event I was also responsible for live transmissions of the news of the events as well as dealing with some editors(portuguese teachers) to assure quality of those.

# Education

In high school, I've studied in two different cities, in _Colégio Nossa Senhora Auxiliadora_ in _Petrolina-PE_ and in _Instituto São José_ at _São José dos Campos-SP_ in those I was engaged with ONU Simulations(_SalesiONU_), the martial band as a trumpetist, and karate as well as reaching the finals of _Google Startup in School_ by "_Ideias de Futuro_" with a team of friends in which we developed from scratch a business based on a device to detect with antecedence forest fires in the amazon rainforest. I was responsible for developing the device with an raspberry pi board and LoRa technology.

Before high school, there is also a highlight, for a "science fair" I developed my first website which raw html and css and hosted at Auxiliadora's network introducing to the tesla's coil. And also learned how to build one, and built, by myself.

After high school, I went to a boarding school in _Fortaleza-CE_ called _Colégio Master_ and prepared myself for the college admission.

Then I got admitted in _University of São Paulo_ and now I'm studying eletrical engeneering and looking for some new challenges. Here I keep it up with the subjects and I love what I do, but also I'm engaged with karate and some side subjects on machine learning.

I'm leaning to play violin and piano, guitar and to speak Japanese, Hindi, and whatever else I can.

I've learned from some online courses too, for programming in [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/user/JOAOMIRANDA/fullCertificate/a17c66baf7ecfb46712b81a5d64dcf21) and for speed reading with [Kwik Brain](https://start.kwikbrain.com/reading).

# Skills

I love to learn new things and face challenges.

Due to this learned to code in most programming languages, and the ones I'm not proficient yet it shouldn't take long.

I love to talk to people and crack their puzzles, I'm glad to learn from them and to share the experience that I got until now.

I do some coding challenges for fun, most of them in c++ in the websites: [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset), [Neps Academy](https://neps.academy/) and a bit in [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com)

And this is probabily due to the fact that I love mathematics too.

I know how to deal with simple spreadsheets, but I'm better at data analysis in python notebooks.

# Final Words

I'm obstinate in making the world a better place and this is my way of living every single day. It makes me happy to know that I can do this with the skills I've aquired in my life.
I'm grateful for everyone who has been in this journey with me.
