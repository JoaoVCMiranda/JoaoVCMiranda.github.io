In march I read this great post[^fn-nth-1] from [Professor Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/) which arose in myself the curiosity of what is the importance of cryptography in the modern world and how can we adress it safely with quantum computers.

## What is classical cryptography ?
It's fundamented on the principle that there are _trapdors_ in maths. Tasks which are much much more dificult to undo than to do them.
So for asymmetric cryptography, take the product of two big prime numbers.
Or for symmetric cryptography, scramble the data recursivelly until it's very hard to undo it.

## What do quantum computers have to do with it ?
They can have an advantage on the product of big prime numbers, 

## How safe are symmetrical keys ?

## Next steps ?
