## Can quantum computers solve supertasks or just "big" tasks

Entanglement could be used to rip the causality of complex calculations and once we be able to make one. we could make them all.

But quantum supercomputer don't actually work entangling particles from input and output

## How do quantum supercomputers work ?

   

### Why is it bad for criptograpy ?
Well there was this guy named Shor, which created this fancy algorithm for "discovering" prime numbers in a really fashionable way.
### Is it that bad for criptograpy ?
