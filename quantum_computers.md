## Can quantum computers solve supertasks or just "big" tasks

Entanglement could be used to rip the causality of complex calculations and once we be able to make one. we could make them all.

But quantum supercomputer don't actually work entangling particles from input and output

## How do quantum supercomputers work ?

Supercomputers can do incredibly paralelized tasks, and the "frequency" increases exponentialy with the number of Qubits. For example, a 10 Qubit supercomputer can do 2 times more calculations than a 9 Qubit one. And this is quite fascinating 'cause, 10 Qubit it's about the same numbers of calculations( $2^{10}$ ) a raspberry pi 3 does 1Ghz, but 12 Qubit is the same as an intel i7. And the "available" supercomputers today as the [IBM Osprey](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ibm-quantum-computer-osprey) have 433 Qubit. This is a lot.   

### Why is it bad for criptograpy ?
Well there was this guy named Shor, which created this fancy algorithm for "discovering" prime numbers in a really fashionable way.
